# Blogging Platform

A modern, scalable blogging platform built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Appwrite**. This platform allows users to post, read, and manage blogs with a rich text editor, authentication, and responsive design.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Integrated **Appwrite** for secure login and user management.
- **Rich Text Editing**: **TinyMCE** text editor with advanced text formatting and styling options.
- **State Management**: Utilized **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a mobile-first, modern UI.
- **Form Handling**: Used **React Hook Form** for streamlined form validation and user input handling.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Integrated **React Router** for dynamic client-side routing.
- **Modular Backend**: Appwrite services are modularized for better scalability and maintainability.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Vite
  - Redux Toolkit
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React Router
  - TinyMCE
  - React Hook Form

- **Backend**: 
  - Appwrite (for authentication, database, file storage, and serverless functions)

## Configuration

- Make sure to configure your **Appwrite** credentials in the environment files for the application to work correctly:
  - **Appwrite endpoint URL**: Replace the placeholder with your Appwrite endpoint.
  - **Appwrite project ID**: Add your project ID in the config file.

- View and interact with published blog posts.
- Use the modern, responsive UI that adapts to all screen sizes.

## Developer's Note

I acknowledge that the user interface of this project is not up to the mark. The primary purpose of this project was to dive deep into learning the **React** ecosystem, exploring the technologies in this stack, and understanding **industry-grade coding practices**. It forms an essential part of my React learning journey.  

For a showcase of modern UI design, feel free to check out my other repositories where I have focused on aesthetics and user experience. Additionally, this project's UI is expected to evolve and improve significantly in the future.
